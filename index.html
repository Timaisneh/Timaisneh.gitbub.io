        <h2 class="medium-header">About Me</h2>
        <p>Myself and my family are originally from nigeria, I am the oldest of three boys with an entrepreneur Mom and engineer Dad.</p>
        <p>Growing up in that environment i naturally gravitated toward a technical path where I ended up studying Electrical engineering
          at University of Ontario Institute of Technology graduating with honors whilst having a passion for entrepreneurship and sales
          as well.</p>
        <p>Because of my studies i have been fortunate enough to give back to the community as a volunteer as well as working 
          professionally with Ledcor Technical Solutions as their sales rep, Sobeys as an order picker both being canadian companies and 
          i also worked with the Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics as an Electrical Engineering Intern.</p>
        </p>I aspire to starting a company of my own one day so i hope to utilize my rapid learning skills and gain as much knowledge 
          possible in a Technical Environment while contributing to the success of your organization!</p>

        <p>Develop Image Processing Algorithms</p>
        <p>In the following algorithms we will be transmitting two pixels at once for faster processing speed. Before the images can be processed they have to be converted to bmp first then to hexadecimal as verilog cannot read images directly. The BMP format is often used in image processing and computer vision applications because it provides an uncompressed representation of an image’s pixel values, making it easy to extract and manipulate the pixel values. Additionally, BMP files have a simple file structure, which makes them easy to work with.
        </p>

        <p>Brightness Addition/Subtraction</p>
        <p>The brightness addition/subtraction algorithm works by adding or subtracting a constant value to every pixel in an image, which changes the brightness level of the entire image.
          When a positive constant is added to every pixel, the brightness level of the image is increased. This means that the image appears brighter, with lighter colors and more contrast between the different shades of colors.
          On the other hand, when a negative constant is subtracted from every pixel the brightness level of the image is decreased. This means that the image appears darker, with darker colors and less contrast between the different shades of colors.
          </p>

        <p>Inverting</p>
        <p>The inverting algorithm works by reversing the brightness values of the pixels in the image. This is done by subtracting each pixel’s brightness value from the maximum possible brightness value, here it is 255.
        </p>

        <p>Thresholding(Black/White)</p>
        <p>Thresholding is a simple technique that converts a grayscale image to a binary image, where the pixels are either black or white. This is done by setting a threshold to white and all the pixels with values below the threshold to black.
