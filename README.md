# Michael's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 

## About Me
Myself and my family are originally from nigeria, I am the oldest of three boys with  an entrepreneur Mom and engineer Dad.

Growing up in that environment i naturally gravitated toward a technical path where I ended up studying Electrical engineering at University of Ontario Institute of 
Technology graduating with honors whilst  having a passion for entrepreneurship and sales as well.

Because of my studies i have been fortunate enough to give back to the community as a volunteer as well as working professionally with Ledcor Technical Solutions 
as their sales rep, Sobeys  as an order picker both being canadian companies AND i also worked with the Hong Kong based company Hanson Robotics as an Electrical 
Engineering Intern.

I aspire to starting a company of my own one day so i hope to utilize my rapid learning skills and gain as much knowledge possible in a Technical 
Environment while contributing to the success of your organization!!!!
